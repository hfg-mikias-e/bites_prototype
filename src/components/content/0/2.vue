    <p>All you need for this is a timer (whether digital or analogue).</p>
    <p>Perhaps you even have an old <span style="color: #E73D3D">kitchen timer in the shape of a tomato</span>? The inventor of the pomodoro technique, Francesco Cirillo, had one of them (pomodoro is the Italian word for tomato)!</p>
